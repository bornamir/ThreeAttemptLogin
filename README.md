# Three Attempt Login

This project is created for a job interview. The project description is:

> Create an authentication system where if a user fails to enter password 3 times, it bans the user login attempts for 1 hour .
>
> Also same rule applies if the user wants to recover account with SMS verification.

Backend is developed with django and python. Django default authentication system is used for controlling the login and signup process. 

Limiting login attempts is done with the help of [django-axes](https://pypi.org/project/django-axes/) app. The combination of username and IP address is used for defining a user attempt. 

Since this is not a real world applicable project, the default database - sqlite3 - is used and the project is deployed in [http://bornamir.pythonanywhere.com](http://bornamir.pythonanywhere.com)Â .
